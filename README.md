Are you ready for some extreme pun-ishment? Well then try out team VDs 
newest game The Gobfather. This game has everything you could ever want 
out of a top-down bullet HELL, such as Orcs to kill, bad puns and 
so... many... pizzas...

Witness a collective of bad ideas such as an unhealthy obsession with 
pizza, puns and pills.

The VD bar is one of the most unique features of the game, a mechanic
wherein you have to work fast to keep your Vitamin D levels high for 
the best chance for premium loot!

But if think popping a few pills is the only interesting thing in this 
game you would be mistaken, there is plenty to keep the mind occupied 
from table flipping for when the meal just wasn't good enough and it 
makes you mad to a Boss battle where he won't wait for you to come to 
him, he will surf the pizza all the way to you! And with the maps being 
procedurally generated you will have a new experience every time.

Playing this game is like drinking a fine wine filled with interesting 
flavours but you might not know what colour it should be by the end. 
One of our games interesting 'flavours' is the unique aesthetic to the 
cell shaded art helping it to look crisp and sweet. Another 'flavour' 
would be the replayability that the weapons and other collectables 
provide giving a nice fruity twist, with the final few drops of the 
bottle providing a dash of competitiveness though the scoring system.

Think your hard-core enough to take on the Orc Mafia? Only the pun-iest 
people have made it to the end and survived.
